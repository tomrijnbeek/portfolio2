          <span class="hi">Hi,</span>

          <p>
            I'm Tom Rijnbeek, an experienced software engineer and coffee
            drinker. My first introduction to the world of programming was
            through game development, and both game programming and game design
            are ever close to my heart. Experience with building games, my
            theoretical mathematics roots, and a strong feel for software
            architecture and design are all important to me, and have provided
            me with a unique set of skills. More information on my current and
            past projects and experience can be found below. You can also find
            my blog <a href="https://tomrijnbeek.me/blog"
            target="_blank">here</a>.

          <h2>Games</h2>
          <p>
            I would never have gotten into programming if it weren't for games.
            I started making my own games using RPG Maker, but it didn't take
            long before I dove into the code of the engine, and started molding
            it into a shape I was happy with. This is where my first programming
            experience came from.
          </p>
          <p>
            The RPG Maker engine was limited, but it wasn't until I learned
            using Microsoft's XNA Framework in university that I starting making
            my own games from scratch. Most games never made it past a
            proof-of-concept phase, though I did enter some games in the Ludum
            Dare, a 48 hour game jam. A particular highlight is <a
            href="https://github.com/tomrijnbeek/ludum-dare-32"
            target="_blank">Satellites vs Aliens</a>, where you shoot
            skyscrapers into space to bump satellites into the path of the
            invading aliens, in a game jam where the theme was "an
            unconventional weapon".
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            <a href="https://rochefusion.com" target="_blank">Roche Fusion</a>
            was the first commercial project I worked on. It was built while
            still attending university. The game is built on a custom game
            engine, using the open source OpenTK to handle graphics and audio.
            With just two programmers, and a small team in general, this is the
            project where I learnt a lot not just about game programming, but
            also game design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roche Fusion is a top-down space shoot-em up, including many
            roguelike elements such as perma-death, completely procedurally
            generated levels, randomised upgrade paths, and more. I was mainly
            responsible for the procedural generation systems, enemy behaviour,
            audio engine, and Steam integration, among other things.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game was released on <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/334140/Roche_Fusion/"
            target="_blank">Steam</a> in January 2015. The game has gotten
            favourable ratings, and received a free content update four months
            after release.
          </p>

          <hr>
          <p>
            After Roche Fusion and finishing my master thesis, I focused on my
            career as a software engineer. Many parts of Roche Fusion that we
            considered useful to the wider community were released into the open
            source domain as the <a
            href="https://github.com/beardgame/utilities"
            target="_blank"><code>Bearded.Utilities</code></a> library (a
            reference to an early codename for Roche Fusion). Two years after
            the release of Roche Fusion, in January 2017, we decided to start a
            new project. <code>Bearded.TD</code> remains under active
            development today, and has the <a
            href="https://github.com/beardgame/td" target="_blank">full
            source</a> available on GitHub. As
            <code>Bearded.TD</code> grows, so do my contributions to the set of
            open-source libraries that we have built around them.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            As part of working on game code, I look for interesting
            architectural problems. Games are traditionally known to accumulate
            much technical debt, or make potentially bad trade-offs in the name
            of performance or velocity. The set of libraries in our GitHub
            organisation contain many tools to keep game code well designed and
            maintainable. Having a job outside of the games industry, while
            being an active maintainer of game libraries allows me to take
            lessons from one world, and applying to another. <a
            href="https://tomrijnbeek.me/blog" target="_blank">My blog</a> is
            full of
            these lessons.
          </p>

            Besides developing my own game, I actively maintain my enthusiasm
            for the world of game mechanics. I enjoy analysing game mechanics in
            existing games, and drawing lessons out of them. Not only
            videogames, but also tabletop games hold an interest for me. This
            passion is the best when shared, and you will regularly find game
            design related topics on <a href="https://tomrijnbeek.me/blog"
            target="_blank">my blog</a>, or find me contributing as producer on
            a podcast and online blog dedicated to the shared appreciation of
            the design and lore of RuneScape on <a href="https://rsbandb.com"

          <h2>Personal</h2>
          <p>
            Besides spending my spare time on making and analysing games, I also
            enjoy playing them. It is not rare for me to comment on desicions
            regarding game mechanics or audio though.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another of my passions is tabletop games, and I will happily spend
            hours on building for my own world with its own rich history and
            events. Collecting all this work into a digestable format is still
            work-in-progress.
